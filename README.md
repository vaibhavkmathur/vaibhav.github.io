- This Project ‘ An Algorithmic Approach to Identify Similar Products on an e-Commerce Platform’ is a step directed towards research in the field
of devising a comparison model to find similar products from the database of a marketplace. Our research on this topic will help the industry to move towards automation and deliver accurate competitive analysis to justify marketing expenditure. For this project, a public dataset with image and text features was used to identify Cosine similarities by deploying EfficientNetB0, Sentence BERT, and Word2Vec models to find the most similar products.
